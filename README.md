## About me
Hey there! I'm Ahsan, a passionate Software Developer who thrives on crafting high-quality, scalable digital solutions. I specialize in building efficient, high-performance web applications, seamlessly integrating frontend and backend technologies.

I have expertise in React.js for building modern user interfaces and FastAPI, Node.js, C#, .NET, and Python for developing robust backend systems. My experience extends to MSSQL and PostgreSQL, where I design and optimize databases for performance and scalability. Additionally, I focus on architecting scalable, optimized systems that ensure long-term efficiency, maintainability, and reliability.

## Currently Learning

I am currently focused on learning how to design large-scale backend systems, delving into the principles of scalable architecture, distributed computing, and robust data management. At the same time, I am deeply exploring the world of large language models (LLMs), studying their underlying technologies, training methodologies, and practical applications in real-world scenarios. My goal is to build a strong foundation in both backend system design and advanced AI models to create innovative and efficient solutions.
